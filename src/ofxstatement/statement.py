    Generate a unique transaction id.

    A bit of background: the problem with these transaction id's is that
    they do do not only have to be unique, they also have to stay the same
    for the same transaction every time you generate the statement.  So
    generating random ids will not work, even though they will be unique,
    GnuCash or beancount will recognize these transaction as "new" if you
    happen to generate and import the same statement twice or import two
    statements with overlapping periods.

    The function generate_transaction_id() is deterministic, but does not
    necesserily generate an unique id.

    Therefore this function improves on it since you can create a
    really unique id by adding an increment to the generated id (a string)
    and keep on incrementing till it succeeds.

    These are the steps:
    1) supply a unique id set you want to use for checking uniqueness
    2) next you generate an initial id by calling
       generate_transaction_id()
    3) assign the initial id to the current id (id)
    4) increment a counter while the current id is a member of the set and
       add the counter to the initial id and assign that to the current id
    5) add the current id to the unique id set
    6) return a list of the current id and the counter (if not 0)

    The counter is returned in order to enable the caller to modify
    its statement line, for example the memo field.
